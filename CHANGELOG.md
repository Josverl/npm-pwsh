# vNEXT

* 

# v0.0.6

* Fix broken 6.0.3 metadata.
* Fix bug in --global installations; was not getting npm prefix correctly.

# v0.0.5

* Publishes tagged packages that install a specific version of PowerShell Core rather than the latest version.
* Bundles via webpack to eliminate all npm dependencies and install faster.
* `--global` installs cache in npm prefix; local installations still cache in $HOME

# v0.0.4

* I did not keep a changelog for this version and prior.
